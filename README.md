Exo
====


Exo is a new Browser and more importantly a new Experimentation Platform to build a better Browser for today's Web.

- **Free** Open-source, and most importantly freed from any assumptions we have about web browsing
- **Usable** Disruptive but only if it's easy to use and easy to learn
- **Hackable** Empower users with the ability to easily change or extend the behaviour of their browser

Exo is scriptable, it is based on the ExoBrowser API (Chromium Content API + Simple View Model exposed in Javascript) and is entirely written in Javascript.

See [The Experimentation Platform to Build a Next Generation Browser](https://github.com/spolu/exo/wiki/The-Experimentation-Platform-to-Build-a-Next-generation-Web-Browser)

Before releasing a fully-fledged browser, our goal is to run a set of experiments to explore specific concepts we find particularly interesting: 

- *Experiment 1*: Stacked Navigation
- *Experiment 2*: Synchronized Sessions

Each experiments will be released as a specialized browser, whose feature set is focused on the related experiment.
